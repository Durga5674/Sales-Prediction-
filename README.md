# Sales-Prediction
# Project Overview

This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict product Sales based on advertising spending across three channels:

TV Advertising

Radio Advertising

Newspaper Advertising

The goal is to analyze how each marketing channel influences sales and to create a model that accurately predicts sales from given advertisement budgets.

# Key Features

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Handle missing values and outliers

Build multiple regression models

Compare models with and without insignificant variables

Evaluate model performance using:

R² / Adjusted R²

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Visualize data relationships and residuals

# Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Statsmodels

Scikit-learn
